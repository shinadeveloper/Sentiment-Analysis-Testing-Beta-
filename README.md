## Prerequisites

### Python 3.7 Installation

1. Download Python 3.7 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/).
2. Run the Windows x86-64 executable installer.
3. During installation, ensure to:
   - Add Python 3.7 to your system PATH.
   - Select "Install launcher for all users" and "Add Python 3.7 to PATH."
4. Complete the installation process and verify Python 3.7 installation by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### Setting up the Environment

1. Open a command prompt and execute:
   ```bash
   set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Python3
   ```
2. Edit system variables, adding `C:\Program Files\Python3` to the PATH variable.
3. Verify the Python version:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Getting Started

### Verifying Python Installation

Ensure Python 3.7 is installed:
```bash
python --version
```

### Installing Libraries

Install required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

After installation, close the command prompt.

### Verifying Library Installation

Verify libraries by running commands in Python IDLE for Python 3.7.0:
```python
import pip
import numpy
import pandas
import matplotlib
import seaborn
import plotly
```
